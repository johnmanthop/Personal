This is a project i created during the second semester of the university. It imitates a banking system. 
The main purpose was to better grasp the concepts of iheritance, virtual functions etc.., and to better understand the c++ syntax 
regarding that. Obviously it is very object oriented and that was the main purpose. 
Most class functions are dummy, and don't have any serious functionality. The idea was to grasp how a big and complicated class diagram was designed and implemented and how all those objects interact with one another.
