C program to send and recieve files and messages between two clients
Press 0 at the start to act as server
Press 1 at the start to act as client (that is connect to some server)
Right now only localhost ip works

Use \ to switch between text and file modes
at file mode type the name of the file and press enter
at text mode type yout message and press enter

There is room for a lot of improvment but I don't have time right now

Known bug: some times (at big files) there is a synchronization error message
